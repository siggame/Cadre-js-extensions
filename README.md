# Cadre JavaScript extensions

JavaScript extensions to base prototypes among shared Cadre projects.

This extends the base prototypes/objects for:

* String
* Array
* Math

Note: the Object prototype should **never** be extended via this project. Any good JavaScript developer should know all the controversy revolving around that prospect.
